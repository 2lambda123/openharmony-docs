This section defines the core mechanism and functions of the TypeScript-based declarative development paradigm. It describes declarative UI descriptions, componentization mechanisms, UI state management, rendering control syntax, and syntactic sugar to enhance programming language functionality.

Follow the provided guidelines for UI development. For details about the components, see  [Components](ts-universal-events-click.md).

>![](../../public_sys-resources/icon-note.gif) **NOTE:** 
>-   All examples use the TypeScript \(TS\) language. If you are using other languages, comply with the syntax requirements of the corresponding language.
>-   The components used in the examples are preset in the UI framework and are used only to explain the UI description specifications.
>-   Common attribute and event methods generally apply to all components, and the attribute and event methods within a component apply only to the current component.
