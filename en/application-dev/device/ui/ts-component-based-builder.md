# @Builder


The @Builder decorated method is used to define the declarative UI description of a component and quickly generate multiple layouts in a custom component. The functionality and syntax of the @Builder decorator are the same as those of the [build Function](ts-function-build.md).



```
@Entry
@Component
struct CompA {
  size : number = 100;

  @Builder SquareText(label: string) {
    Text(label)
      .width(1 * this.size)
      .height(1 * this.size)
  }

  @Builder RowOfSquareTexts(label1: string, label2: string) {
    Row() {
      this.SquareText(label1)
      this.SquareText(label2)
    }
    .width(2 * this.size)
    .height(1 * this.size)
  }

  build() {
    Column() {
      Row() {
        this.SquareText("A")
        this.SquareText("B")
        // or as long as tsc is used
      }
      .width(2 * this.size)
      .height(1 * this.size)
      this.RowOfSquareTexts("C", "D")
    }
    .width(2 * this.size)
    .height(2 * this.size)
  }
}
```

## @BuilderParam<sup>8+</sup>

The @BuilderParam decorator is used to modify the function type attributes (for example, @BuilderParam content: () => any) in a custom component. When the custom component is initialized, the attributes modified by the @BuilderParam decorator must be assigned values.

### Background

In certain circumstances, you may need to add a specific function, such as a click-to-jump action, to a custom component. However, embedding an event method directly inside of the component can add the function to all places where the component is initialized. This is where the @BuilderParam decorator come into the picture. When initializing a custom component, you can assign a @Builder decorated method to the @BuilderParam decorated attribute, thereby adding the specific function to the custom component.

### Component Initialization Through Parameters

When initializing a custom component through parameters, assign a @Builder decorated method to the @BuilderParam decorated attribute â€”content, and call the value of content in the custom component.

```
@Component
struct CustomContainer {
  header: string = "";
  @BuilderParam content: () => any;
  footer: string = "";
  build() {
    Column() {
      Text(this.header)
        .fontSize(50)
      this.content()
      Text(this.footer)
        .fontSize(50)
    }
  }
}

@Entry
@Component
struct CustomContainerUser {
  @Builder specificParam(label: string) {
    Column() {
      Text(label).fontSize(50)
    }
  }

  build() {
    Column() {
      CustomContainer({
        header: "Header",
        content: this.specificParam("111")
        footer: "Footer",
      })
    }
  }
}
```

### Component Initialization Through Trailing Closure

In a custom component, use the @BuilderParam decorated attribute to receive a trailing closure. When the custom component is initialized, the component name is followed by a pair of braces ({}) to form a trailing closure (CustomComponent(){}). You can consider a trailing closure as a container and add content to it. For example, you can add a component ({Column(){Text("content")}) to the closure. The syntax of the closure is the same as that of [build](ts-function-build.md). In this scenario, the custom component has one and only one @BuilderParam decorated attribute.

Example: Add a &lt;Column> component and a click event to the closure, and call the specificParam method decorated by @Builder in the new &lt;Column&gt; component. After the &lt;Column&gt; component is clicked, the value of the component's header attribute will be changed to changeHeader. In addition, when the component is initialized, the content of the trailing closure will be assigned to the closer attribute decorated by @BuilderParam.

```
@Component
struct CustomContainer {
  header: string = "";
  @BuilderParam closer: () => any;
  build() {
    Column() {
      Text(this.header)
        .fontSize(50)
      this.closer()
    }
  }
}
@Builder function specificParam(label1: string, label2: string) {
  Column() {
    Text(label1)
      .fontSize(50)
    Text(label2)
      .fontSize(50)
  }
}
@Entry
@Component
struct CustomContainerUser {
  @State text: string = "header"
  build() {
    Column() {
      CustomContainer({
        header: this.text,
      }){
        Column(){
          specificParam("111", "22")
        }.onClick(()=>{
          this.text = "changeHeader"
        })
      }
    }
  }
}
```
