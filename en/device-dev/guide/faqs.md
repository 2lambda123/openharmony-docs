1.  **Why can't I continue device control after I exit the app and access the control page again?**

    Currently, each time you access the app, you must reset the device and configure the network to obtain a new control channel. If the device is not reset, it will maintain the previous network configuration status and the network control fails.

2.  **Do I have to use OneHop to access the network configuration feature?**

    No. You can also directly open the device configuration page of the  **entry**  module for network configuration. Taping against an NFC tag is used to start the atomic service and obtain the device information.

3.  **After I click the Configure network button, the network configuration progress is stuck at 20% and then a failure message is displayed. What can I do?**

    This may occur when the app is killed or exited abnormally last time, as a result of the unstable performance of the network configuration version on the device side.

    If the network configuration fails, exit the app, reset the device, and try again.
