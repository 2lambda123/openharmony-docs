    2.  Click the dustbin for the terminal using the serial port to disable the terminal.


### What should I do when the image failed to be burnt?<a name="section1370982513317"></a>

-   **Symptom**

    The burning status is not displayed after clicking  **Burn**  and selecting a serial port.

-   **Possible Causes**

    The IDE is not restarted after the DevEco plug-in is installed.

-   **Solutions**

    Restart the IDE.


### What should I do when no command output is displayed?<a name="section183421944953"></a>

-   **Symptom**

    The serial port shows that the connection has been established. After the board is restarted, nothing is displayed when you press  **Enter**.

-   **Possible Cause 1**

    The serial port is connected incorrectly.

-   **Solutions**

    Change the serial port number.

    Start  **Device Manager**  to check whether the serial port connected to the board is the same as that connected to the terminal device. If the serial ports are different, perform step 1 in the  **Running an Image**  section to change the serial port number.


-   **Possible Cause 2**

    The U-Boot of the board is damaged.

-   **Solutions**

    Burn the U-Boot.

    If the fault persists after you perform the preceding operations, the U-Boot of the board may be damaged. You can burn the U-Boot by performing the following steps:


1.  Obtain the U-Boot file.

    >![](public_sys-resources/icon-notice.gif) **NOTICE:** 
    >The U-Boot file of the two boards can be obtained from the following paths, respectively.
    >Hi3516D V300:  **device\\hisilicon\\hispark\_taurus\\sdk\_liteos\\uboot\\out\\boot\\u-boot-hi3516dv300.bin**
    >Hi3518E V300:  **device\\hisilicon\\hispark\_aries\\sdk\_liteos\\uboot\\out\\boot\\u-boot-hi3518ev300.bin**

2.  Burn the U-Boot file by following the procedures for burning a U-Boot file over USB.

    Select the U-Boot files of corresponding development boards for burning by referring to  [Programming Flash Memory on the Hi3516](https://device.harmonyos.com/en/docs/ide/user-guides/hi3516_upload-0000001052148681)/[Programming Flash Memory on the Hi3518](https://device.harmonyos.com/en/docs/ide/user-guides/hi3518_upload-0000001057313128)

3.  Log in to the serial port after the burning is complete.

### What should I do when Windows-based PC failed to be connected to the board?<a name="section1215410450215"></a>

-   **Symptom**

    The file image cannot be obtained after clicking  **Burn**  and selecting a serial port.

    **Figure  2**  Failed to obtain the image file due to unavailable connection<a name="en-us_topic_0000001128470856_fig135261439195819"></a>  
    ![](figures/failed-to-obtain-the-image-file-due-to-unavailable-connection.png "failed-to-obtain-the-image-file-due-to-unavailable-connection")

-   **Possible Causes**
