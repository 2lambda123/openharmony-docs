### What should I do when the message  **cannot find -lgcc**  is displayed during compilation and building?<a name="section141771701647"></a>

-   **Symptom**

    The following error occurs during compilation and building:

    ```
    riscv32-unknown-elf-ld: cannot find -lgcc
    ```


-   **Possible Causes**

    The PATH is incorrectly written by  **gcc\_riscv32**. There is an extra slash \(/\).

    ```
    ~/gcc_riscv32/bin/:/data/toolchain/
    ```
